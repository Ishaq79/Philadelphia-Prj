        The city is a melting pot of races, traditions and immigrant cultures
        and also possesses amenities that only the city's own heritage can
        provide. It is the home to the Liberty Bell and the Declaration of
        Independence, both tributes to the city's revolution.

        <h2>About that Brotherly Love...</h2>
        <p>
          Founded by William Penn, Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is
          Greek for brotherly love (from philos, "love" or "friendship", and
          adelphos, "brother"). As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious
          persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could
          worship freely.

        <h3>From Statesmen to Cheesesteaks</h3>
        <p>
          According to Philadelphia's official tourism site, Pat Olivieri
          invented the cheesesteak in the 1930s. Olivieri was a hot dog vendor
          in south Philadelphia who, as the story goes, decided to grill some
          beef from the butcher and put it on an Italian roll. A cab driver
          caught a whiff and asked for a steak sandwich.

        <h3>Tour Accordingly</h3>
        <p>
          While you're in town, be sure to step back and admire some of the
          city's unique collection of public art, including everything from
          sculptures to fountains to murals. The endeavor is a prime example of
          the city's well-known grassroots culture. Perhaps as a vestige of
          Philly's storied revolutionary history, residents here have a
          reputation for being very involved in their communities and local
          activities:
